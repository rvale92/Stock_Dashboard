# Stock Analysis Dashboard

A React-based stock analysis dashboard and watchlist application for tracking and analyzing stocks.

## Features

- **Watchlist**: Add and manage stocks to watch
- **Stock Charts**: Visualize stock price movements over time
- **Analytics Panel**: View key metrics and statistics
- **News Feed**: Stay updated with latest stock-related news

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- (Optional) API keys for Alpha Vantage and/or Finnhub for better performance

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rvale92/Stock_Dashboard.git
   cd Stock_Dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. (Optional) Configure API keys:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your API keys (see `API_SETUP.md` for details)
   - The app works with demo keys but has rate limits

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app

## Deployment

### Live Version

The app is live on GitHub Pages at: **https://rvale92.github.io/Stock_Dashboard**

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. **Install gh-pages** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

2. **The `package.json` is already configured with:**
   - `homepage` field pointing to GitHub Pages URL
   - `predeploy` script to build the app
   - `deploy` script to publish to gh-pages branch

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   This will:
   - Build the production version
   - Create/update the `gh-pages` branch
   - Push to GitHub
   - Make the app live at the GitHub Pages URL

4. **After deployment:**
   - Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update
   - Visit https://rvale92.github.io/Stock_Dashboard
   - Check the GitHub repository Settings â†’ Pages to verify deployment

### Deployment Troubleshooting

**Issue**: App doesn't load or shows blank page
- **Solution**: Ensure `homepage` in `package.json` matches your GitHub Pages URL exactly
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `gh-pages` branch exists in repository

**Issue**: Assets not loading (404 errors)
- **Solution**: Assets are served from root path, ensure `homepage` is set correctly
- Clear browser cache
- Check Network tab in browser dev tools

**Issue**: API calls failing after deployment
- **Solution**: API keys must be set as environment variables during build
- For GitHub Pages, consider using a backend service or GitHub Secrets for API keys
- See `API_SETUP.md` for detailed API configuration

**Issue**: Routing doesn't work (404 on refresh)
- **Solution**: This is expected for client-side routing on GitHub Pages
- Consider using HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter for GitHub Pages
- Or configure GitHub Pages to redirect all routes to index.html

### Environment Variables for Production

For GitHub Pages deployment, you'll need to handle API keys differently:

1. **Option 1: Build-time variables** (requires rebuilding on each deploy)
   - Set variables before running `npm run build`
   - Variables are embedded in the build

2. **Option 2: Runtime configuration** (recommended)
   - Use a config file that's loaded at runtime
   - Or use a backend proxy for API calls

3. **Option 3: Public API keys** (not recommended for production)
   - Only use free-tier APIs with public keys
   - Be aware of rate limits and security implications
